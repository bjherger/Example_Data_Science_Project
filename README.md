# Python Starter Repo

A brief, snappy description of what this project does, and why the audience cares

## Quick start

```python
# Set up Anaconda virtual environment
conda env create -f environment.yml --force

# Activate Anaconda virtual environment
source activate (environment_name)

# Run code
cd bin/
python main.py
```

## Repo structure

 - `bin/main.py`: Code entry point
 - `conf/conf.py`: Configuration file for project

### Python Environment
Python code in this repo utilizes packages that are not part of the common library. To make sure you have all of the 
appropriate packages, please install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), and install the environment 
described in environment.yml (Instructions [here](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html), under *Use 
environment from file*, and *Change environments (activate/deactivate)*).
