# Titanic data model

A pipeline to predict whether or not Titanic passengers survived. For a further dive into the problem space and data 
set, see [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). 

This repo is both an opportunity to build a great model, and to explore what a great data pipeline can look like.  

## Quick start

```python
# Set up Anaconda virtual environment
conda env create -f environment.yml --force
